# Understand host networking configuration on the cluster nodes

## CKA Exam Study Guide: Understanding Host Networking Configuration on the Cluster Nodes

### Overview
Understanding the host networking configuration on the cluster nodes is crucial for Kubernetes administrators. This involves comprehending how networking works at the node level, the interaction between pods and the host network, and managing network interfaces and routes.

### Key Concepts

1. **Node Networking Basics**:
   - Each Kubernetes node has its own network namespace.
   - Nodes communicate with each other and external networks through various interfaces and routing rules.
   - Pods can either share the node's network namespace (hostNetwork) or have their own isolated namespace.

2. **Network Interfaces**:
   - Nodes typically have multiple network interfaces (e.g., `eth0`, `cni0`, `flannel.1`).
   - Each interface can have multiple IP addresses and routes configured.
   - Common commands to inspect network interfaces: `ip addr`, `ip link`, `ifconfig`.

3. **Routing**:
   - Nodes maintain routing tables to direct traffic appropriately.
   - Routes can be inspected and managed using commands like `ip route`, `route`.
   - Understanding of pod-to-pod communication, pod-to-service communication, and external traffic routing is essential.

4. **iptables**:
   - Kubernetes uses `iptables` to manage network rules.
   - `iptables` rules control network traffic flow, NAT, and port forwarding.
   - Commands to manage `iptables` include: `iptables -L`, `iptables -t nat -L`.

5. **Network Namespaces**:
   - Network namespaces isolate the network configurations of different pods.
   - Inspect namespaces using `ip netns` (if available).
   - `nsenter` can be used to enter a different namespace.

### Key Commands

#### Inspecting Network Interfaces
```sh
# List all network interfaces
ip addr

# Alternative way to list network interfaces
ifconfig
```

#### Checking Routes
```sh
# Display routing table
ip route

# Alternative way to display routing table
route -n
```

#### Managing iptables
```sh
# List all iptables rules
sudo iptables -L

# List NAT table rules
sudo iptables -t nat -L
```

#### Working with Network Namespaces
```sh
# List network namespaces (requires iproute2 tools)
ip netns

# Enter a specific network namespace
sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/<namespace>
```

### Practical Exercises

1. **Inspect Node Networking**:
   - Log into a Kubernetes node and list all network interfaces using `ip addr`.
   - Check the routing table using `ip route`.

2. **Explore iptables Rules**:
   - List all `iptables` rules on a node using `sudo iptables -L`.
   - Identify rules related to Kubernetes services and pod networking in the NAT table using `sudo iptables -t nat -L`.

3. **Network Namespace Exploration**:
   - List all network namespaces available on the node using `ip netns`.
   - Enter the network namespace of a running pod and inspect its network interfaces and routes.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Pod Networking**:
   - Verify that a pod with `hostNetwork: true` can access the node's network interfaces directly.
   - Check the routing from a pod to an external service.

2. **Node-to-Node Communication**:
   - Verify that nodes can communicate with each other over the cluster network.
   - Inspect the routes and ensure they are correctly configured for pod-to-pod communication across nodes.

Understanding the host networking configuration on cluster nodes is a foundational skill for a Kubernetes administrator. Ensure you are comfortable with the concepts and commands outlined in this guide, and practice regularly to reinforce your knowledge.

## CKA Exam Study Guide: Understanding Connectivity Between Pods

### Overview
Understanding connectivity between pods in Kubernetes is essential for managing and troubleshooting inter-pod communication. This involves knowing how pods communicate within the same node, across different nodes, and the role of Kubernetes networking components in facilitating this connectivity.

### Key Concepts

1. **Pod Network Model**:
   - Kubernetes uses a flat network model where every pod gets its own IP address.
   - Pods can communicate with each other using these IP addresses without NAT.

2. **Cluster Networking**:
   - Each pod is assigned an IP from the cluster's network range.
   - Kubernetes uses network plugins (CNI) to implement the cluster network.

3. **Service Discovery**:
   - Services provide stable endpoints to access pods.
   - Services use ClusterIPs, NodePorts, or LoadBalancers to expose pods.

4. **Network Policies**:
   - Network policies control the traffic flow between pods.
   - Policies can specify allowed ingress and egress traffic.

5. **DNS for Service Discovery**:
   - Kubernetes provides a built-in DNS server that resolves service names to IP addresses.
   - Pods can use these DNS names to communicate with services.

### Key Commands

#### Inspecting Pod Networking
```sh
# Get details of a specific pod
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o wide

# Get IP address of all pods in a namespace
kubectl get pods -o wide

# Describe a pod to see detailed information, including network details
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

#### Working with Services
```sh
# List all services in a namespace
kubectl get svc

# Describe a service to see detailed information
kubectl describe svc <service-name>

# Create a simple ClusterIP service
kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port>

# Create a service from a YAML file
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

#### Network Policies
```sh
# List all network policies in a namespace
kubectl get networkpolicy

# Describe a network policy
kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy-name>

# Apply a network policy from a YAML file
kubectl apply -f networkpolicy.yaml
```

#### DNS and Service Discovery
```sh
# Check the DNS entries of a service
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>

# Test connectivity to a service using curl
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- curl <service-name>:<port>
```

### Practical Exercises

1. **Inspect Pod Network**:
   - Create a pod and inspect its IP address using `kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o wide`.
   - Verify the pod's network details with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.

2. **Service Exposure**:
   - Expose a pod with a ClusterIP service using `kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --port=80 --target-port=8080`.
   - Check the service's ClusterIP with `kubectl get svc` and use it to curl from another pod.

3. **Network Policies**:
   - Create a network policy that restricts traffic to a pod using a YAML file.
   - Apply the policy with `kubectl apply -f networkpolicy.yaml` and verify the connectivity changes.

4. **DNS and Service Discovery**:
   - Deploy two pods and a service.
   - Use `nslookup` and `curl` to test DNS resolution and connectivity between pods.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Same Node Communication**:
   - Deploy two pods on the same node.
   - Verify that they can communicate using their IP addresses.

2. **Cross-Node Communication**:
   - Deploy pods on different nodes.
   - Verify inter-pod communication using IP addresses and services.

3. **Service Discovery**:
   - Create a service and ensure pods can reach it using DNS names.
   - Verify that DNS names resolve correctly within pods.

4. **Network Policy Enforcement**:
   - Implement a network policy to restrict traffic to a specific pod.
   - Test the enforcement of the policy by attempting to connect from different pods.
