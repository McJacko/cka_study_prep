First off, the exam is not really tough. By that I mean that out of the 17 questions, 8 were straightforward that you could execute with just a couple of commands. 3-4 were slightly involved but the instructions are crystal clear, so if you know what to do, you shouldn't face any hassles.

The rest of them , around 5, will take up the bulk of your time.

Focus areas are:

Volumes -- PVs, PVCs, SCs

RBAC -- know how to verify once you provision them

Network Policies -- my Achilles heel

Services (especially NodePorts)

Upgrade a node to a target version

Troubleshoot "unready" nodes

Monitoring and logging -- easy

Sidecars -- really struggled with this one

ETCD backup and restore

Deployment scaling and recording

Draining nodes

The best courses and material to clear the exam easily are:

Kodekloud/Udemy's course by Mumshad Mannambeth. When it comes to labs and practice, nothing tops this.

The Ultimate CKA course by Nana Janashia -- a super course that helped me understand the nitty-gritties of a Kubernetes cluster. Amazing stuff if you really want to understand what is happening behind the scenes in a K cluster. Also, plenty of tips for verifying services/ingress etc. and troubleshooting.

The Network Policies recipes here: https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes -- Do not under any circumstances overlook this goldmine of network policy examples. Super important.
